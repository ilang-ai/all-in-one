## Install

### Claude Code (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add ilang-ai/all-in-one
/plugin install all-in-one@ilang-skills
```

### Codex CLI

```bash
npx skills add ilang-ai/all-in-one
```

### Manual test

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilang-ai/all-in-one.git
claude --plugin-dir ./all-in-one
```

### Any SKILL.md-compatible agent

Copy `skills/all-in-one/SKILL.md` into your agent's skills directory.

## How It Works

On first run the skill has a short conversation with you. **Not about your
project, about you.** How you work, what you've shipped, what went wrong,
what you prefer.

That conversation becomes a **portable profile** stored in your project.
Under 500 tokens. Structured. Readable. Yours.

Every session after that, the skill applies your preferences automatically:
your code style, your debugging approach, your planning rhythm, your design
taste, your git habits. All personalized. All compressed. All portable.

**Switch models. Switch platforms. Switch projects. Your profile comes with you.**

## What It Replaces

| You used to install...        | All-in-One does it by                                                        |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude-mem` (memory)        | Stores **how you work**, not what happened. ~90% smaller.                    |
| `Caveman` (compression)      | Structured format is the default, not a mode.                                |
| `onboard`                    | Project context extraction on first run.                                     |
| Code-review skills           | Cross-model review against **your** standards, not universal rules.          |
| `systematic-debugging`       | Architecture first, then binary search. Lessons become immunity.             |
| `superpowers` (planning)     | Your rhythm, not a fixed methodology. ~80% fewer tokens.                     |
| Progress-tracking skills     | Auto-checkpoint on meaningful state changes.                                 |
| TDD skills                   | Resources decide strategy. Multi-model or single, auto-adapts.               |
| Git-workflow skills          | Every commit is SEO. README is a landing page.                               |
| `seo-audit`                  | Structured output is native GEO. No audit needed.                            |
| Copywriting skills           | Tone, terminology, and rhythm derived from your profile.                     |

**11 skills → 1 file → 19 agents.**

| *+ 10 more*     | ✅     | SKILL.md standard    |

</div>

Any agent that speaks the SKILL.md standard works. **19 agents** today, more
as the standard spreads.

## Your Profile Is Yours

The profile is a **plain text file** sitting next to your code. You own it.

- **Read** it, no black box, no vendor cache
- **Edit** it, nudge a preference, commit the change
- **Version** it, it's just git
- **Share** it, hand it to a teammate, they inherit your working style
- **Port** it, every SKILL.md agent speaks the same file

Switch tools, the file comes with you. No lock-in. Ever.

---

## Schema at a Glance

```text
META        profile version, identity hash, last-updated
FACT        immutable preferences (code style, license, naming)
PROJECT     current project shape, stack, constraints
PROGRESS    checkpoints, decisions, lessons
RUNTIME     per-session volatile state
```

Five layers. One file. Under 500 tokens.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Keep the profile under 500 tokens and the file
human-readable, those are the two hard constraints.
