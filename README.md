> **Imprint**, *verb.* To stamp a mark that cannot be erased.
> *noun.* The mark itself, permanent, portable, unmistakably yours.

> In ethology, *imprinting* is the moment a young animal learns, once and

> This project is that mark, for human-AI work.

## What this is

**Imprint** is a single plugin that captures **how *you* work** and
carries it across every AI agent you use.

On first run, the skill has a short conversation with you. **Not about your
project, about you.** How you debug, how you plan, how you write commits,
what you've shipped, what went wrong, what you prefer.

That conversation becomes a **portable profile**, a working imprint, stored
alongside your code. Under 500 tokens. Structured. Readable. Yours.

Every session after that, the skill applies your imprint automatically:
your code style, your review standards, your planning rhythm, your design
taste, your git habits. Across 19 agents. Across every project.

**Switch models. Switch platforms. Switch teams. Your imprint comes with you.**

## What It Replaces

One file. Eleven capabilities. Zero dependencies.

| You used to install...        | Imprint does it by                                                            |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude-mem` (memory)        | Stores **how you work**, not what happened. ~90% smaller.                    |
| `Caveman` (compression)      | Structured format is the default, not a mode.                                |
| `onboard`                    | Project context extraction on first run.                                     |
| Code-review skills           | Review against **your** standards, not universal rules.                      |
| `systematic-debugging`       | Architecture first, then binary search. Lessons become immunity.             |
| `superpowers` (planning)     | Your rhythm, not a fixed methodology. ~80% fewer tokens.                     |
| Progress-tracking skills     | Auto-checkpoint on meaningful state changes.                                 |
| TDD skills                   | Resources decide strategy, multi-model or single, auto-adapts.               |
| Git-workflow skills          | Every commit is SEO. README is a landing page.                               |
| `seo-audit`                  | Structured output is native GEO. No audit needed.                            |
| Copywriting skills           | Tone, terminology, and rhythm derived from your imprint.                     |

**11 skills → 1 imprint → every agent.**

Any agent that speaks the SKILL.md standard works. **19 agents** today,
more as the standard spreads.

## Your imprint is yours

The imprint is a **plain text file** sitting next to your code. You own it.

- **Read** it, no black box, no vendor cache
- **Edit** it, nudge a preference, commit the change
- **Version** it, it's just git
- **Share** it, hand it to a teammate, they inherit your working style
- **Port** it, every SKILL.md agent speaks the same file

Switch tools, the imprint comes with you. No lock-in. Ever.

---

## Schema at a glance

```text
META        imprint version, identity hash, last-updated
FACT        immutable preferences (code style, license, naming)
PROJECT     current project shape, stack, constraints
PROGRESS    checkpoints, decisions, lessons
RUNTIME     per-session volatile state
```

Five layers. One file. Under 500 tokens.

## Changelog

### v2.0 (2026-04-18)
- **Schema 2.0**: CORE/PROJECT layered separation. Global genes no longer mix with project overrides.
- **Conditional genes**: `T:minimal|when:simple` + `T:full_detail|when:complex`. Context-dependent behavior.
- **Five conflict types**: user vs history, global vs project, two confirmed contradicting, multi-agent disagreement, lesson vs task. Each with explicit resolution.
- **Progress compression**: auto-summarize every 10 entries, keep file lean.
- **User transparency**: quiet/explain/audit three modes, natural switching.
- **Reflexion reframed**: part of the thinking process, not an extra API call. Zero visible latency.
- **Context drift protection**: re-read profile before major decisions in long sessions.
- **Team override**: project linter and team style rules always override personal genes.
- **Speed mode**: `RUNTIME{speed:fast}` skips reflexion for latency-sensitive work.
- **Version sync**: all manifests aligned to 2.0.0.

### v1.5 (2026-04-18)
- **Add** reflexion loop for single-model code review: AI self-critiques and fixes its own output before presenting to user
- **Improve** code review no longer uses a static checklist, now runs an active self-correction cycle checking against user's profile and lessons

### v1.4 (2026-04-18)
- **Rebrand** from all-in-one to Imprint
- **Add** Imprint design assets: banner, logo, social preview
- **Add** `.cursor-plugin/` for Cursor Marketplace compatibility
- **Add** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for self-distribution
- **Submit** to Claude Code official marketplace and Cursor Marketplace

### v1.3 (2026-04-18)
- **Add** plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) for official marketplace
- **Move** SKILL.md to `skills/imprint/SKILL.md` per plugin spec
- **Update** install instructions for plugin format

### v1.2 (2026-04-18)
- **Fix** enforce *one question per message* with explicit forbidden/correct examples
- **Fix** platform memory cache no longer bypasses onboarding
- **Improve** Rule 1 and Rule 2 promoted to top-level critical rules
- **Improve** onboarding wrap-up phrasing more natural

### v1.1 (2026-04-18)
- **Fix** onboarding now asks one question at a time (was dumping 4-6 at once)
- **Fix** never expose internal terminology to user
- **Add** activation rules with auto-trigger on session start
- **Add** conflict resolution, mutation, decay, priority rules
- **Add** upgraded schema with META / FACT / PROJECT / PROGRESS / RUNTIME layers

### v1.0 (2026-04-18)
- Initial release

Issues and PRs welcome. Keep the imprint under 500 tokens and the file
human-readable, those are the two hard constraints.
